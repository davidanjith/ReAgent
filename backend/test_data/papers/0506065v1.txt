Ramp secret sharing (SS) schemes can be classified into strong ramp SS
schemes and weak ramp SS schemes. The strong ramp SS schemes do not leak out
any part of a secret explicitly even in the case where some information about
the secret leaks from a non-qualified set of shares, and hence, they are more
desirable than weak ramp SS schemes. However, it is not known how to construct
the strong ramp SS schemes in the case of general access structures. In this
paper, it is shown that a strong ramp SS scheme can always be constructed from
a SS scheme with plural secrets for any feasible general access structure. As a
byproduct, it is pointed out that threshold ramp SS schemes based on Shamir's
polynomial interpolation method are {\em not} always strong.
