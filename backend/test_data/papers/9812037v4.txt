"Quantum Topology" deals with the general quantum theory as the theory of the
functional quantum space; space time and energy momentum forms form a connected
manifold; a functional quantum space on the quantum level. The general quantum
theory derives from the topology of the quantum space.
  "Quantum Topodynamics" derives from quantum topology, it deals with the set
that underlies the assumed one structure of the topology, group and logic
structure of the quantum space. The underlying structure was founded on the
Fourier representation of the functional space.
  "Differential Topology in Quantum Space" deals with the method of analysis
approperiate for the quantum space; based on the Fourier representation of the
functional space.
  "Gauge Theory of Gravitation" deals with gravitation as a quantum topological
phenomenon; by introducing the effect of gravitation into the quantum space
through a phase angle; this displays its unity with the rest of the gauge
interactions and shows that the manifold is compact.
