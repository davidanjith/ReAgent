Microorganism enumeration is an essential task in many applications, such as
assessing contamination levels or ensuring health standards when evaluating
surface cleanliness. However, it's traditionally performed by human-supervised
methods that often require manual counting, making it tedious and
time-consuming. Previous research suggests automating this task using computer
vision and machine learning methods, primarily through instance segmentation or
density estimation techniques. This study conducts a comparative analysis of
vision transformers (ViTs) for weakly-supervised counting in microorganism
enumeration, contrasting them with traditional architectures such as ResNet and
investigating ViT-based models such as TransCrowd. We trained different
versions of ViTs as the architectural backbone for feature extraction using
four microbiology datasets to determine potential new approaches for total
microorganism enumeration in images. Results indicate that while ResNets
perform better overall, ViTs performance demonstrates competent results across
all datasets, opening up promising lines of research in microorganism
enumeration. This comparative study contributes to the field of microbial image
analysis by presenting innovative approaches to the recurring challenge of
microorganism enumeration and by highlighting the capabilities of ViTs in the
task of regression counting.
