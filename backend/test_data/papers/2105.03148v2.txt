Microorganisms play a vital role in human life. Therefore, microorganism
detection is of great significance to human beings. However, the traditional
manual microscopic detection methods have the disadvantages of long detection
cycle, low detection accuracy in large orders, and great difficulty in
detecting uncommon microorganisms. Therefore, it is meaningful to apply
computer image analysis technology to the field of microorganism detection.
Computer image analysis can realize high-precision and high-efficiency
detection of microorganisms. In this review, first,we analyse the existing
microorganism detection methods in chronological order, from traditional image
processing and traditional machine learning to deep learning methods. Then, we
analyze and summarize these existing methods and introduce some potential
methods, including visual transformers. In the end, the future development
direction and challenges of microorganism detection are discussed. In general,
we have summarized 142 related technical papers from 1985 to the present. This
review will help researchers have a more comprehensive understanding of the
development process, research status, and future trends in the field of
microorganism detection and provide a reference for researchers in other
fields.
