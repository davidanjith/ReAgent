The Crump-Young model consists of two fully coupled stochastic processes
modeling the substrate and microorganisms dynamics in a chemostat. Substrate
evolves following an ordinary differential equation whose coefficients depend
of microorganisms number. Microorganisms are modeled though a pure jump process
whose the jump rates depend on the substrate concentration. It goes to
extinction almost-surely in the sense that microorganism population vanishes.
In this work, we show that, conditionally on the non-extinction, its
distribution converges exponentially fast to a quasi-stationary distribution.
Due to the deterministic part, the dynamics of the Crump-Young model is highly
degenerated. The proof is then original and consists of technical sharp
estimates and new approaches for the quasi-stationary convergence.
