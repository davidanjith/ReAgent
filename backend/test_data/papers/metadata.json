However, traditional microorganism\nmanual counting methods, such as plate counting method, hemocytometry and\nturbidimetry, are time-consuming, subjective and need complex operations, which\nare difficult to be applied in large-scale applications. In order to improve\nthis situation, image analysis is applied for microorganism counting since the\n1980s, which consists of digital image processing, image segmentation, image\nclassification and suchlike. Image analysis-based microorganism counting\nmethods are efficient comparing with traditional plate counting methods. In\nthis article, we have studied the development of microorganism counting methods\nusing digital image analysis. Firstly, the microorganisms are grouped as\nbacteria and other microorganisms. Then, the related articles are summarized\nbased on image segmentation methods. Each part of the article is reviewed by\nmethodologies. Moreover, commonly used image processing methods for\nmicroorganism counting are summarized and analyzed to find common technological\npoints. More than 144 papers are outlined in this article. In conclusion, this\npaper provides new ideas for the future development trend of microorganism\ncounting, and provides systematic suggestions for implementing integrated\nmicroorganism counting systems in the future. Researchers in other fields can\nrefer to the techniques analyzed in this paper.",

However, the traditional\nmanual microscopic detection methods have the disadvantages of long detection\ncycle, low detection accuracy in large orders, and great difficulty in\ndetecting uncommon microorganisms. Therefore, it is meaningful to apply\ncomputer image analysis technology to the field of microorganism detection.\nComputer image analysis can realize high-precision and high-efficiency\ndetection of microorganisms. In this review, first,we analyse the existing\nmicroorganism detection methods in chronological order, from traditional image\nprocessing and traditional machine learning to deep learning methods.

In the end, the future development\ndirection and challenges of microorganism detection are discussed. In general,\nwe have summarized 142 related technical papers from 1985 to the present.

However, it's traditionally performed by human-supervised\nmethods that often require manual counting, making it tedious and\ntime-consuming. Previous research suggests automating this task using computer\nvision and machine learning methods, primarily through instance segmentation or\ndensity estimation techniques. This study conducts a comparative analysis of\nvision transformers (ViTs) for weakly-supervised counting in microorganism\nenumeration, contrasting them with traditional architectures such as ResNet and\ninvestigating ViT-based models such as TransCrowd. We trained different\nversions of ViTs as the architectural backbone for feature extraction using\nfour microbiology datasets to determine potential new approaches for total\nmicroorganism enumeration in images. Results indicate that while ResNets\nperform better overall, ViTs performance demonstrates competent results across\nall datasets, opening up promising lines of research in microorganism\nenumeration. This comparative study contributes to the field of microbial image\nanalysis by presenting innovative approaches to the recurring challenge of\nmicroorganism enumeration and by highlighting the capabilities of ViTs in the\ntask of regression counting.",

To take advantages of both networks, we employ the multimodal\ntransformer to combine supervised learned static information and unsupervised\nlearned movement information. The experimental results show that combing both\nnetwork allows the prediction accuracy reached at 88.3$\\%$ IOU and 93.6$\\%$\nprecision, outperforming the original supervised baseline 1.2$\\%$ and 2.4$\\%$.\nCompared with most of the existing citrus segmentation methods, our method uses\na small amount of supervised data and a large number of unsupervised data,\nwhile learning the pixel level location information and the temporal\ninformation of citrus changes to enhance the segmentation effect.",

Nucleic acid and serology-based methods of detection and,\nimmunochromatographic assays are commonly used but these laboratory tests are\nlaborious, expensive and might be subjected to cross-reaction and\ncontamination. Modern optical spectroscopic techniques offer a promising\nalternative as they are label-free, sensitive, rapid, non-destructive, and\ndemonstrate the potential for incorporation into an autonomous system for\ndisease detection in citrus orchards. Nevertheless, the majority of optical\nspectroscopic methods for citrus disease detection are still in the trial\nphases and, require additional efforts to be established as efficient and\ncommercially viable methods. The review presents an overview of fundamental\nworking principles, the state of the art, and explains the applications and\nlimitations of the optical spectroscopy technique including the spectroscopic\nimaging approach (hyperspectral imaging) in the identification of diseases in\ncitrus plants. The review highlights (1) the technical specifications of\noptical spectroscopic tools that can potentially be utilized in field\nmeasurements, (2) their applications in screening citrus diseases through leaf\nspectroscopy, and (3) discusses their benefits and limitations, including\nfuture insights into label-free identification of citrus diseases. Moreover,\nthe role of artificial intelligence is reviewed as potential effective tools\nfor spectral analysis, enabling more accurate detection of infected citrus\nleaves even before the appearance of visual symptoms by leveraging\ncompositional, morphological, and chemometric characteristics of the plant\nleaves. The review aims to encourage stakeholders to enhance the development\nand commercialization of field-based, label-free optical tools for the rapid\nand early-stage screening of citrus diseases in plants.",

They were found to be in a good quantitative agreement with the\ntheory. (ii) It was shown that the mechanism of SS amplitude saturation is due\nto the nonlinear attenuation of SS via three wave interactions between the SS\nwaves. Strong low frequency amplitude fluctuations of SS above the threshold\nwere observed. The spectra of these fluctuations had a universal shape with\nexponentially decaying tails. Furthermore, the spectral width grew continuously\nwith the FS amplitude. The role of three and four wave interactions are\ndiscussed with respect to the nonlinear SS behavior. The first evidence of\nGaussian statistics of the wave amplitudes for the parametrically generated\nwave ensemble was obtained. (iii) The experiments on simultaneous pumping of\nthe FS and independent SS waves revealed new effects. Below the instability\nthreshold, the SS phase conjugation as a result of three-wave interactions\nbetween the FS and SS waves was observed. Above the threshold two new effects\nwere found: a giant amplification of the SS wave intensity and strong resonance\noscillations of the SS wave amplitude as a function of the FS amplitude.\nQualitative explanations of these effects are suggested.",

On the other hand, in many General Quantum Theories, a geometrical\nobject which we call \"quantum kernel\" arises, which is invariant under the\nunitary group $\\mathbf{U}(V,\\varphi)$, and which carries the geometry of a\nso-called polar space. We use this object to construct new quantum\n(teleportation) coding schemes, which mix quantum theory with the geometry of\nthe quantum kernel (and the action of the unitary group). We also show that in\ncharacteristic $0$, every General Quantum Theory over an algebraically closed\nfield behaves like classical Quantum Theory over $\\mathbb{C}$ at many levels,\nand that all such theories share one model, which we pin down as the \"minimal\nmodel,\" which is countable and defined over $\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}$. Moreover,\nto make the analogy with classical Quantum Theory even more striking, we show\nthat Born's rule holds in any such theory. So all such theories are not modal\nat all. Finally, we obtain an extension theory for General Quantum Theories in\ncharacteristic $0$ which allows one to extend any such theory over\nalgebraically closed fields (such as classical complex Quantum Theory) to\nlarger theories in which a quantum kernel is present.",
