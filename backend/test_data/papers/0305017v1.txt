Recent development in quantum computation and quantum information theory
allows to extend the scope of game theory for the quantum world. The authors
have recently proposed a quantum description of financial market in terms of
quantum game theory. The paper contain an analysis of such markets that shows
that there would be advantage in using quantum computers and quantum
strategies.
