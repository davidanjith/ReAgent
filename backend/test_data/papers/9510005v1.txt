The agenda of quantum algorithmic information theory, ordered `top-down,' is
the quantum halting amplitude, followed by the quantum algorithmic information
content, which in turn requires the theory of quantum computation. The
fundamental atoms processed by quantum computation are the quantum bits which
are dealt with in quantum information theory. The theory of quantum computation
will be based upon a model of universal quantum computer whose elementary unit
is a two-port interferometer capable of arbitrary $U(2)$ transformations. Basic
to all these considerations is quantum theory, in particular Hilbert space
quantum mechanics.
